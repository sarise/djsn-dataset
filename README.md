# djsn_scrapper

This is a simple script to automate the data collection from the Dewan Jaminan Sosial Nasional (DJSN) offical website (http://sismonev.djsn.go.id). The website contains statistical data related to the Indonesian social welfare system. I focus on the state-owned healthcare insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional a.k.a. JKN) data.
